# Fishboy Hilbert’s no bullshit evidence-based guide to freshwater aquaria
*(NOTE: this guide is work in progress - I would appreciate any sort of feedback given to me, and we are currently working on an infographic to summarise all this information)*

Taking care of an aquarium can be made easy, but one must know the biochemistry. Buying a fish from your local fish store (LFS) is probably cheap, but keeping one healthy and happy would require a lot more effort and money outside of just getting a dechlorinator.

I’m gonna keep this short and simple: if you intend to get a fish, and you want it to be happy, these are some key points I will highlight that will prevent your fish from kicking the bucket within a few days. Read this through and it will spare you a lot of heartbreak.

### Understanding basic chemistry

A knowledge in water chemistry is absolutely essential. In the wild, there are vast ecosystems in play. These ecosystems regulate everything from oxygen, to food, to everything else. However, any typical home aquarium can only scarcely attempt to reproduce the natural systems. Although fish can be hardy creatures, subjecting them to suboptimal conditions outside of their range of adaptability will ultimately lead to premature death, no matter the good intentions of the owner.

Many beginner aquarists find that their fishes kick the bucket within a few weeks, or if unlucky, a few days. Most of the time fishes can live far longer than this prescribed period. In other words, if an animal in an aquarium died, there’s usually a damned good reason for why, and not the common myth that fishes cannot live for long once they’re bought out of the LFS. It all depends on the care and understanding of the owner with water chemistry.

Fish stress is fish stress - there are no two-ways around it. A clear understanding on how to remedy an aquaria’s problem is by far the most effective solution.


### General chemistry terms used in aquaria:
```
ppth - parts per thousand
ppm - parts per million
ppb - parts per billion
ppt - parts per trillion
pH - the acidity or alkalinity of water
GH/general hardness/hardness - the concentration of dissolved ions
KH/carbonate hardness/total alkalinity - the concentration of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate ions
Salinity - the concentration of dissolved sodium ions
SG/specific gravity - the ratio of the aquarium water density compared to pure water
```


### Water volume

Water volume increases the buffer for mistakes in an aquaria.

### Feeding

Feeding generally should not exceed 4% of the fishes’ body weight per day, and any excess in feeds can lead to premature death from overeating.

To put this in perspective, a tetra from the LFS typically weighs around 0.14 g, while a typical molly at around 0.3 g. This means the amount of food given to a typical small tropical fish should, by general rule, not exceed 14 mg per day.

The general rule of thumb amongst aquarists is enough food for the fishes to complete in less than three minutes.
Oxygen

Animals in your aquaria need oxygen. Oxygen is vital for the survival of any aerobic organism, and your aquarium’s pets are definitely not an exception.

Fishes and shrimp breathe through their gills. Unlike humans, fishes can generally only absorb oxygen dissolved in the water. This means that if your water isn’t oxygenated enough, your fish will suffocate.

Solution:

With the exception of a few fishes (i.e. bettas), a bubbler is almost always required for fish.
```


### Temperature

This point is closely linked to oxygen. The higher the temperature, the less oxygen can be dissolved per unit volume of water.

This is explained by Henry’s law. Partial pressure of oxygen in the air decreases as temperature rises, meaning less of it will be dissolved in water.

Tropical fish are more adapted to a hotter environment (think 28℃), while coldwater fish are more adapted to cooler environments (think 20℃). Tropical fish include tetras, danios, while goldfish are coldwater fish.

```css
Solution:

Do not mix coldwater and tropical fish together. Make sure you do proper research on the type of fish beforehand.```
```

### Chlorine

This one’s a no-brainer. Most tap water around the world is chlorinated to keep it clean. Unfortunately, the dissolved chlorine also burns the gills of fish. Imagine your lungs being burnt - awful ain’t it?

```css
Solution:

Add dechlorinator (typically sodium thiosulfate) to your water and wait for five minutes before using the water. Alternatively, you can let your water sit around for three days before using it.
```


### pH

Different fish come from different types of water, right? pH is generally not the biggest hoo-haa as compared to other factors, but a sudden shift in pH can result in what’s known as pH shock, which will lead to death.

pH outside of an acceptable range for fishes can lead to stunted growth, and increased susceptibility to disease. In nature, low pH is typically caused by tannins and humic acids being leached into the water, which both come from plant leaves. One can imagine that said acidic water can be found generally in forested streams, where leaf litter leaches these acids into the water. Contrastingly, high pH can be caused by presence of rocks such as limestone - the fishes that live in these waters include African cichlids.

To be safe, a typical pH value of 7.0 is usually fine for most fishes.

### Nitrogen

One of the most highly overlooked key parts with beginner freshwater aquarists. Nitrogen is a key ingredient in amino acids and life, as they form part of the building blocks such as proteins. In the aquaria, animals will defecate and release waste into the water. Unlike humans, fishes literally have to swim in their own waste, which in certain forms can be highly toxic.

Undigested fish food, decaying plants, fish waste, or any other non-living organic matter in the aquaria is quickly converted into __ammonia__ by bacteria and fungi. Ammonia exists dissolved in water as ammonium (a cation), and the names are used interchangeably. Ammonia is acutely toxic in the aquarium and can burn your fish.

Ammonia is nitrified by ammonia-oxidising bacteria, mainly in the genus *Nitrosomonas*, and rarely *Nitrosococcus* and *Nitrosospira* into __nitrite__. These three genus of bacteria use ammonia as an energy-source and dissolved oxygen to make water and nitrite. Nitrite is toxic to aquarium inhabitants, as it halts oxygen exchange into bloodstream, making the animals suffocate.

Lastly, nitrite is further nitrified by nitrite-oxidising bacteria, mainly in the genus *Nitrobacter*, and also *Nitrospina*, *Nitrococcus*, and *Nitrospira* into __nitrate__. Similar to ammonium nitrification, this process requires oxygen but does not produce water. Nitrate is a lot less toxic than ammonia or nitrite. However, it can cause stunted growth in aquaria animals, harm their reproductive system, and reduce their lifespan.

Solution:

Cycle your aquarium BEFORE adding any fishes. If you are impatient, use a biostarter to kickstart the nitrogen cycle.
```

### Filtration

Filtration can be classified into three categories - physical, biological and chemical filtration. (WIP)

### Denitrification

### Incompatible fish

Imagine being locked up with a lion in a cage. Not the most pleasant experience eh? Aquaria inhabitants are generally classified with temperament. Temperament is essentially how likely that inhabitant is going to beat other folks in the aquarium.

```css
Solution:

Always check up the temperament of your fish before adding them to ensure compatibility.
```

### Salinity

Water salinity is measured by parts per thousand (ppth). For 1 ppth of sodium chloride in water, it is equivalent to 1 gramme of salt in a total of 1,000 grammes of saltwater.

### Water movement
